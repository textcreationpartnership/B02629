            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THough it hath not been deemed prudent, that Legiſlators ſhould in their Acts and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons render their reaſons of them; leſt by ſo doing, they might haply invite and court contradiction from ſome ill-affected thereunto, which might prove derogatory unto their Supreme Authority, by giving occaſion to the governed to wreſtle with their reaſons rendred and alledged; and if they ſhould think (though erroneouſly) that they have reſolved or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed them, they would then alſo think that they have taken all vertue and efficacy from the very Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Yet it hath ever been eſteemed acceptable and good Service to Government it ſelf, that Subjects ſhould defend the juſt Laws of their Princes, and eſpecially thoſe wherein Religion is concerned. And Religion being, or ought to be, the grand concern of every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, I hope I ſhall not be thought to wander inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately out of my own Province, whilſt I endeavour to juſtifie the late <hi>Act of Parliament for preventing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which may happen from Popiſh Recuſants.</hi> I muſt confeſs that I dare not adventure my Salvation or Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on blind obedience, or Implicite Faith, or on any Deputies, Proxies, Popes, Prieſts or Fryars, nor
<pb facs="tcp:179814:3"/>take their bare word without expreſs warranty from Scripture, eſpecially being commanded to <hi>ſearch them, and</hi> thereby <hi>to try them that ſay they are Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>are not,</hi> and being pre-cautioned, <hi>leſt by good words and fair ſpeeches the Hearts of the ſimple be deceived,</hi> Rom. 16.17. In which kind of Arts the Papalins are moſt expert.</p>
            <p>I have expoſed this Treatiſe to the conſideration of all Chriſtians, but more eſpecially of all Kings, Princes, and Governours, not to implore their Countenance or Protection of any error, that haply may be found here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; that were not only unmannerly, but injurious to Majeſty it ſelf. If what is here written cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by its own truth, and effort of ſound reaſon, let it fall to the ground, and be obliterate for ever: For no error or falſhood, or any falſe equivocating reaſonings can ever be pleaſing to the God of Truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be ſupported or countenanced by any ſublunary Majeſty whatſoever. <hi>Juſta ratio ſapientem non poſſit offendere.</hi> The chief aim and great deſign in this Publication, is to juſtifie to all the Chriſtian World His Majeſties great Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> truly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Catholick and Apoſtolick by his ready compliance with His great Council, his Two Houſes of Parliament, to put away the evil from this our <hi>Iſrael</hi> by this His <hi>Act;</hi> that both this and future Ages, perceiving it to have been grounded both on great reaſons of State, and true grounds of Religion, all the World may be the better ſatisfied, and his own Subjects <hi>may hear and fear, and do no more ſo preſumptuouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the great duty of every individual Chriſtian <hi>for Truth and Conſcience ſake,</hi> but more eſpecially of Gods Lieutenants on Earth, <hi>even for neceſſity, and reaſon of good
<pb facs="tcp:179814:3"/>government alſo,</hi> nay, even out of duty to him by whom they reign to maintain and preſerve Religion in its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For this very end God hath ordained Kings and Queens to be his Vicegerents on Earth, and conferred greatneſs and Majeſty upon them to make them Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers of his Holy Church;</hi> in which Calling the greateſt of them can never give a good account of this their Charge and Stewardſhip, except it be by a conſtant watchful care in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. As it is not prudent in civil Politicks for any Prince to receive a great ſuccour from a more puiſſant Empire; ſo it is as imprudent for any temporal Prince or Power to indulge or countenance any Sects that own any dependence on a Foreign Head, Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, eſpecially if Sworn to advance that Head and promote his Intereſt. And ſuch a Head is the <hi>Pope,</hi> who claims to be ſuperiour to all Princes, to be exempt from all Controll, and exempts his Eccleſiaſticks from their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience unto their natural Princes, <hi>and whom</hi> (if you will believe them) <hi>they cannot chaſtiſe, though they are rebellious; that he hath Power over all, and can deprive Kings of their Kingdoms, that in any difference between the Eccleſiaſtical and Secular, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appertains to the Eccleſiastical as to the more worthy: And as is the Pope, ſo are his Papalins. The ſame Hour they become his Proſelytes, they alſo become his ſworn Vaſſals and Advocates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can it be other than an infinite prejudice done to the Authority of Sovereign Princes, if they ſhould but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinely permit, or be conſtrained to change, or but to ſuſpend their own Laws at the Beck, and Pleaſure of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther State or Intereſt, paſſing from one Law to another;
<pb facs="tcp:179814:4"/>or tacitely by conniving only to acknowledg, that he borrows from any other any power of governing in matters Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, and therefore but juſt and reaſonable for Princes to ſecure their own power by wholſome Laws, preventing all Popiſh influencies, that haply by ſome Wiles or politick Stratagems might oppoſe them, or interfere with them, in order to gratifie and ſupport their own intereſt, contrary to the intereſt of thoſe Princes whoſe Subjects they are.</p>
            <p>The main Bane of true Church power hath been the great opinion that the Antient and firſt converted Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors had of the Abilities, piety and devotion of the Antient Fathers Eccleſiaſticks, which confidence begat in them ſupineſs and negligence of their own power, and that gave occaſion and encouragement to the Popes and their Eccleſiaſticks to uſurp and encroach upon their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whilſt they little regarded their own power, which God had fairly ſtampt upon them; conſequently neglecting their duty, as if they were to render no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God for themſelves or their Subjects, as if the care and defence of Religion and Piety were the leaſt of their concerns, tolerating for their own intereſt the people to be deceived, by ſuffering the Pope to ſet up new Orders and Rites under the <hi>umbrello</hi> of Religion, but in reality for his own Empire and profit, without conſidering that ſuch Orders and Cuſtoms by tract of time carry along with them their own warranty, and ſo ſecretly invite belief, which at length become meerly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the intereſts of thoſe that manage them (<hi>viz.</hi> the Popes) and conſequently diſſerviceable and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous unto Princes, and all temporal Governments: And ſuch Orders being received and continued by the
<pb facs="tcp:179814:4"/>preſent Princes, are no ſmall obligations to their Heirs and Succeſſors to continue them by reaſon of that former Authority engraven upon them by Cuſtom, and their Predeceſſors. Now, what does this Act do? give a ſtop to the open, and publick profeſſion of the <hi>true Antient Catholick and Apoſtolick Faith,</hi> as the Romaniſts beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and give out. Nothing leſs! It only diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the publick and open Profeſſion of the Romiſh Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine Faith, which (in thoſe Articles wherein they differ from the Proteſtants) is neither <hi>True,</hi> nor <hi>Antient,</hi> nor <hi>Catholick,</hi> but is an <hi>entire Apoſtaſie</hi> from it, and doubtleſs is <hi>the moſt Catholick, and greateſt Hereſie in the Chriſtian World.</hi> A Religion, that upon due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and chioce, no Man can embrace without reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>his Maker, and his Redeemer,</hi> by renouncing his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nay his very outward ſenſes wherewith God hath endued him. A Religion, that by the ſame reaſon that they endeavour to juſtifie Tranſubſtantiation (I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in this, becauſe I find more do wave the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Act on the account of the Declaration and Subſcription, than of the Oaths therein) a Man may as well believe every Hobby-horſe to be a Barbe or Courſer of <hi>Naples,</hi> or the picture of every Bruit on a Sign-poſt to be really the Bruit it ſelf: Nay to doubt, or deny that ever there was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth, <hi>or that, he or any of the Saints which ſlept, did riſe from the dead after him; or that the Graves did open, or that the Vail of the Temple was rent, or that there was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over the whole Land from the ſixth hour to the ninth,</hi> &amp;c. I appeal to all the World if ever God declared either by word or practice, that he would make uſe of <hi>artes praeſtigiariae,</hi> Jugling Arts, by <hi>deceptio ſenſuum,</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:179814:5"/>otherwiſe. Nay, hath not his practice ever been clearly contrary in all the Miracles that he or his Son ever wrought? And the learnedſt of the Romaniſts would infinitly oblige us if they would demonſtrate unto us, which of Chriſts Body it is, that is Corporally in the Sacrament, whether his <hi>glorified,</hi> or <hi>not glorified Body,</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> it of all the monſtrous abſurdities that opinion is guilty of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Antient Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick Faith</hi> partakes not of their fopperies, nor of their abſurdities, (for their concealments and ſpunges are no better) needs no captious reaſonings, no equivocations; requires no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, or blind faith or obedience, uſes no knaveries: No, no, <hi>pure Religion,</hi> and <hi>undefiled,</hi> is of a better Brood, of a more Noble Extract, of a more Divine Origine: The profeſſion thereof joyned with Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, ennobles every Soul, ſcorns to obſcure any Truths, needs no prohibition of Gods Word, no <hi>Indices expurgatorii,</hi> hath ſuperlative priviledges, the greateſt ornament any Sublunary Majeſty can have, ſcorns to uſe any indirect Artifices to Create Subtilities, or Coyn Evaſions, to conceal or adulterate any of her Truths from ignorant, or learned, or to abuſe any of our Senſes, as if we could not diſtinguiſh <hi>Bread</hi> from <hi>Stones,</hi> or <hi>Fiſh</hi> from <hi>Serpents.</hi> What have we from without us common to all Mankind ſo infallible as our Senſes to cauſe Belief, that Jeſus Chriſt lived upon the Earth, was Crucified, Buried, and Roſe again? The only Argument that Chriſt himſelf uſed to convince dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidert St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to Believe, was by his own Senſes of ſeeing and feeling, <hi>John</hi> 20.25, 27. And if the Senſes of all Chriſtians in all Countries have been deceived
<pb facs="tcp:179814:5"/>above theſe 1600. years ſince Chriſts death in one Point, why may not we by the ſame reaſon queſtion and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Senſes of all thoſe that lived contemporary with him in more Points, as whether any of theſe things were ſo or no. So happy, I confeſs, are the Papalins in their Diſputes againſt Proteſtant Religion, that many of their Arguments by retortion only are as ſtrong againſt their own Religion, and, indeed as ſtrong againſt all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions as againſt ours. <hi>Light is come into the World, but theſe men love darkneſs rather than light:</hi> And why? <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Deeds are evil; every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be diſcovered; but he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God,</hi> 3 John 19.20, 21.</p>

            <p>In theſe Seminaries it was quickly defined, <hi>That the Pope hath by the Law of God fullneſs of power over the whole World, as well in Eccleſiaſtical as Temporal matters; and that he out of his fulneſs of power may Excommunicate Kings, and being Excommunicate, depoſe them, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance.</hi> Then were divers Prieſts well inſtructed in ſuch Principles and Doctrins ſent into <hi>England.</hi> This done, divers traiterous Combinations and Conſpiracies both Forrein and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick were plotted, as here, ſo elſewhere is related.

               <hi>Scots</hi> ſuch dangerous Councels, that the Seculars after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards charged the <hi>Jeſuits, as procurers and Inſtruments of her death.</hi> And the Jeſuits, when they ſaw there was no hope of reſtoring the Romiſh Religion either by her, or <hi>King James</hi> her Son, began to forge a new and feigned Title in the ſucceſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> (ſo wonderful faithful were they to <hi>King James</hi>) and they ſent into <hi>England</hi> (as <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> ſaith) one <hi>Saimer,</hi> a Man of their Society, to draw a party to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to thruſt the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> forwards to divers dangerous practiſes, by telling her, that if ſhe were refractory, neither ſhe, nor her Son ſhould Reign, <hi>(mjost faithful Men ſtill)</hi> and by exciting the <hi>Guiſes</hi> her Kiſmen to new ſtirs againſt the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condey,</hi> that they might not be able to aid her. This their faith ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (ſuch as it was) laſted not only before <hi>King James</hi> came to the Crown, but afterwards, as will e're long appear. Did not <hi>Fa. Parſons</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> conteſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly with <hi>Fa. Creighton, Parſons</hi> to ſettle the Crown on the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and <hi>Creighton</hi> on the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots?</hi> Did not <hi>Fa.

Did not he perſwade <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Young</hi> to fire Her Majeſties Store-houſes? Did not he perſwade <hi>Fr. Dickenſon,</hi> and others, to tempt Water-men to fly with Ships to the <hi>Spaniards?</hi> as hath been intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dialogue 93.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how many ſeveral Titles did they ſeign, and ſet up to ſet by <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> from the Crown, and to ſet up <hi>M. Q.</hi> of <hi>Scots,</hi> whom they prompted and annimated unto ſo many Concrivances of dangerous Conſequences that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:179814:24"/>brought that <hi>Princeſs</hi> unto that ſad Cataſtrophe, and conſequently were the occaſion thereof, and ſo confeſs'd in print by themſelves? they left no ſtone unturned. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>4th.</hi> would not acknowledg her, and why? Becauſe, forſooth, this Kingdom was held in Fee of the Apoſtolick See; that ſhe could not ſucceed being Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, and that it was a great boldneſs to aſſume the Name and Government without him, and therefore refuſed to hear Sir <hi>Edward Kerne</hi> her Ambaſſador.</p>
            <p>All this, and more, was pretended to have been done in favour of that Admirable perſon <hi>M. Qucen</hi> of <hi>Scots.</hi> But what think you would they have done, if the Tables had been turned? And <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> had been an Illegitimate Papiſt; and <hi>M. Q.</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> a Legitimate proteſtant, would you then have been ſo zealous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious for the <hi>Q.</hi> of <hi>Scots?</hi> Certainly not! which is demonſtrable by their Actings and Endeavours to hinder <hi>King James</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown. And it is plain that it was not Baſtardy, but Hereſie, <hi>i. e.</hi> for being Proteſtant, that made their malice ſo implacable, and this is apparent by the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> V. Dated 25. <hi>Febr.</hi> 1570. in which there is not the leaſt mention of Baſtardy. No, No, Illegitimacy is not ſo monſtrous a Gudgeon, but that it will eaſily be ſwallowed at <hi>Rome. Gregory</hi> XIII. had a Baſtard, <hi>James Buon Compagna,</hi> and to him he gave <hi>Ireland,</hi> and impowred <hi>Stewkely</hi> with Men, Arms and Money to Conquer it for him. And <hi>England</hi> he gave to <hi>Don John</hi> the Emperors Baſtard, (both admirable Catholicks without all peradventure) and gave him leave to Conquer it for himſelf. Chriſts brave Vicard give that which was none of his own, or had any thing to do withall. But that <hi>perverſe Queen</hi> had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179814:25"/>no occaſion to part with either on ſuch ridiculous Nods. And his Succeſſor <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> took no Notice at all of <hi>King James,</hi> proceeded againſt her with all his <hi>Italian</hi> Scarcrows, curſt her afreſh, and publiſht a Croyſade againſt her, and gave all her Dominions to <hi>Philip</hi> II. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> but forgot to give his Benedictions of Craft and Cunning to get them, and ſo they ſtill remain veſted in the hands of the right owners, and long may they ſo do, even till time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>Now, if Romiſh zeal for <hi>Qu. M.</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> had had its Riſe and Original from her more rightful Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> then it would have continued unto <hi>King James</hi> alſo; but their Actings being Diametrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite and contrary, it was viſible to all the World, that it was Popery, not the Title that they contended ſo furiouſly for. And it was the common voice amongſt the Jeſuits of thoſe days, That if <hi>King James</hi> would turn Catholick, they would follow him; but if not they would all die againſt him. <hi>Watſon Quodlib. p.</hi> 150.</p>
            <p>The mtual love and amity that was between <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>King James,</hi>

            <p>To which purpoſe a Book was Dedicated to <hi>Eſſex</hi> under the Counterfeit name of <hi>Doleman,</hi> but wrote by <hi>Par2ons, Cardinal Allen,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Inglefeild,</hi> as was believed.</p>
            <p>In this Book deſpiſing the right of Birth, they project, that the Antient Laws of the Land concerning Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> are to be altered, that new Laws are to be brought in concerning E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; <hi>That no man but a Roman Catholick,</hi>

            <p>I now proceed to ſhew you how faithful the Papiſts were to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> after King <hi>James</hi> came to it.</p>
            <p>The firſt Meritorious Act towards <hi>King James</hi> was to calumniate him with <hi>a breach of promiſe,</hi> as made to ſome of them before he came into <hi>England</hi> for a <hi>Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their Religion, which now he did deny to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, which had this intended double miſchief in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhould bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon him from the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179814:29"/>Proteſtants for making ſuch a promiſe, and the like from the <hi>Papists</hi> for the breaking of it. And unto whom ſhould this promiſe be made but unto that <hi>Arch-traitor Percy,</hi> and to that falſe <hi>Prieſt, Watſon,</hi> both afterwards found in other Treaſons, for which being condemned, <hi>Watſon</hi> confeſſed to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Northampton</hi> (purpoſely ſent by the <hi>King</hi> to examine him who was the firſt firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that falſe report) at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> a day or Two before he was Executed,<note place="margin">17. <hi>b.</hi>
               </note> (at which time no man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to lye) that he never could receive any <hi>ſpark of Comfort</hi> touching eaſe of Counſcience to Catholicks from His Majeſty, how unjuſtly ſoever the World had made him Author of that Scandal; though withall he added, how unwilling he had been to declare to his Fellows how averſe the King ſhewed him in his own Words, leſt over great diſcouragement might render them deſperate. The like did <hi>Percy</hi> (another deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Traitor) aver after his return out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> both before and after the <hi>Queens</hi> death, that in the point of Conſcience he found the Kings intent, and final purpoſe to be peremptory. Proceedings againſt Traitors, 182. <hi>A.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 45.6.46.</p>
            <p>The like ſlander and Scandal was raiſed upon the King by the Lord of <hi>Belmerinoth</hi> his <hi>Scotiſh Secretary,</hi> by ſending the Pope Word the <hi>King James</hi> would become his obedient Son, who afterwards being Arraigned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his offence in deviſing Letters, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to <hi>Rome,</hi> which himſelf got cunningly Signed in ſhuffling them in amongſt others; His Majeſty being utterly ignorant of the Contents. <hi>Speed.</hi> 917.</p>

            <p> Another faithful ſervice towards <hi>King James</hi> his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Crown and Poſterity, was plotted by <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> Two Secular <hi>Italianated Prieſts,</hi> who drew others of the Nobility and Gentry into their Helliſh Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, as Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi> Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh,</hi> Lord <hi>Warden</hi> of the <hi>Stanneries,</hi> Sir <hi>Griffin Markeham,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Parham, George Brooke,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; their deſign was to have ſurpriſed the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his Son <hi>Prince H.</hi> to have kept them priſoners in the <hi>Tower,</hi> or in <hi>Dover Caſtle,</hi> and there by violence to obtain their Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> A Tolleration of Religion, and a removal of evil Councellors, or to put ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther projects in Execution, and then to obtain their Pardons. <hi>Watſon</hi> to have been <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi>

Of thoſe Confederates only Sir <hi>William Parham</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, and Three only Executed, <hi>viz. George Brooke, Clark,</hi> and <hi>Watſon,</hi> who had taught equivocating; and to avoid his other ſolemn proteſtations both by Word and Writing, that the Act was lawful, being done before his Coronation, for that the King was no King before he was Anointed, and the Crown ſolemnly ſet on his Head.</p>
            <p>By this we may conclude, that there is no truſt to be repoſed in Papiſts of any Order. What Man in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:179814:30"/>World could profeſs and publiſh to all the World in Writing more obedience and faithfulneſs to a <hi>Prince</hi> than <hi>Watſon</hi> did to <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> moſt fiercely and bitterly blaming the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> for their iterated and re-iterated Treaſons and Rebellions againſt her, and for creating diſturbances in all the ſtates of the World where they are. As he lived to ſee, ſo I hope he lived to repent of his 2in and error; for he left this brand and ſuſpicion on the <hi>Jeſuitical Order</hi> at his death, that <hi>they in revenge had cunningly and covertly drawn him into this Action, which brought him into this ſhameful End.</hi>

            <p>What could they ſubmit more than they did, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, Lives, Fortunes?

               <p>That grave Rabbies Sentence agreeth with this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Intelligence, which ſhall be juſtified whenſoever Authority will require it: That the Year before the Kings death, a ſelect number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuits were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:179814:43"/>ſent from their whole party in <hi>England,</hi> firſt to <hi>Paris</hi> to conſult with the faculty at <hi>Sorbon,</hi> then altogether Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited, to whom they put this Queſtion in writing: That ſeeing the ſtate of <hi>England</hi> was in a likely poſture to change Government, whether it was lawful for the Catholicks to work the change for the advancing and ſecuring the Catholick Cauſe in <hi>England,</hi> by making away the King, whom there was no hope to turn from his Hereſie? which was anſwered affirmatively. After which the ſame perſons went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion being propounded and debated, it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Pope and his Council, That it was both lawful and expedient for the Catholicks to promote the alteration of State. What followed that Confulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sentence all the World knoweth, and time the bringer forth of Truth will let us know. But when that Horrible Paricide, committed on the Kings Sacred perſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="58"/> was ſo univerſally cryed down as the greateſt Villany that had been committed in many Ages, the <hi>Pope</hi> commanded all the papers about the Queſtion to be gathered and burnt. In obedience to which order a Roman Catholick in <hi>Paris</hi> was demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Copy which he had of thoſe papers; but the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who had refuſed to conſider and deteſt the wickedneſs of that project, refuſed to give it, and ſhewed it to a Proteſant Friend of his, and related to him the whole carriage of this Negotiation, with great abhorrency of the practiſes of the Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of that Order from <hi>Rome</hi> for the pulling down both of the Monarch and Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> many Jeſuits came over, who took ſeveral ſhapes to go about their work, but moſt of them took party in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:179814:43"/>Army. About Thirty of them were met by a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Gentlemen between <hi>Roan</hi> and <hi>Deipe,</hi> to whom they ſaid, (taking him for one of them) That they were going into <hi>England,</hi> and would take Arms in the Independent Army, and endeavour to be Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>A Proteſtant Lady living in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the time of our late Calamities, was perſwaded by a Jeſuit going in Scarlet to turn Roman Catholick: When the diſmal News of the Kings Murder came to <hi>Paris,</hi> this Lady, as all other good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, was moſt deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with it; and when this Scarlet Divine came to ſee her, and found her melting in Tears about that heavy and common diſaſter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="59"/> he told her with a ſmiling Countenance, That ſhe had no reaſon to lament, but rather to rejoice, ſeeing that the Ca-Cholicks were rid of their greateſt Enemy, and that the Catholick Cauſe was much furthered by his death. Upon which the Lady in great anger put the Man down the Stairs, ſaying, <hi>If that be your Religion, I have done with you for ever.</hi>

               <p>Many Intelligent Travellers can tell of the great Joy among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Convents and Seminaries about the Kings death, as having overcome their Enemy, and done their main Work for their ſettlement in <hi>England,</hi> of which they made themſelves ſo ſure, that the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictins were in great care that the Jeſuits ſhould not get their Land: And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nunns were contending who ſhould be Abbeſſes in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>An underſtanding Gentleman viſiting the Friars of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> put them on the diſcourſe of the Kings death, and to pump out their ſence about it, ſaid, That the Jeſuits had laboured very much to compaſs that great
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:179814:44"/>Work: To which they Anſwered, That the Jeſuits would engroſs to themſelves the Glory of all great and good Works, and of this amongſt other Works; whereas they had laboured as diligently, and as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually as they.

That the people are remitted by the evil mannaging, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of their Governour to the force of Nature, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves, and not bound by any promiſe made to their Governour, that the Magistrate by his miſcarriages abdicateth himſelf from being a Magiſtrate, and proveth a Brigand or Robber inſtead of a Defender; that word</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender <hi>he writes with a great D. that the Reader may take notice whom he means. His Book is full fraught with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentations of this Nature.</hi> All in barr and prejudice to His Majeſties Reſtauration. <hi>Of the ſame opinion was</hi> F. F.

            <p>§ Having dwelt thus long on this unpleaſant Theme, it is now time to wind up this Botton, and therefore, Admit the Papiſts had merited in theſe late troubles, as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:179814:44"/>much as they pretend they have, from the King and his Father; yet doth it not follow, that they ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be rewarded with a Tolleration of their Religion, or with any Mitigation of our Laws prohibiting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof, no more than it was fit <hi>Joſeph,</hi> for the good ſervice done to his Maſter, ſhould be be gratified with the company of his Maſters Wife. Neither did his Maſter think this reaſonable, though he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the extraordinary good Service of his Servant, much leſs did <hi>Joſeph</hi> expect it. In like manner the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts muſt firſt ſatisfie us, <hi>That the Tolleration of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not Tolleration of Idolatry,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>Spiritual Adultery,</hi> nor yet the exerciſe of a World of Impieties under the Mask of Religion, before they can convince us (whatever their Loyalty may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be) that it is either lawful or reaſonable for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates (whom the Scripture ſtileth Gods, and who ſtanding in Gods ſtead ought to be as jealous of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in that caſe as a Husband would be of his Wife; Nay, as much as in them lies, even as God himſelf, who profeſſeth himſelf to be a Jealous God) to Authorize or connive at the Exerciſe of ſuch a Religion, or as to account very ſtrict Laws too ſevere in that Caſe, for which there is both Precept and Example in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>It is a very great Truth, That Kings neither can, nor ought to give permiſſion or allowance of any things, which in their own Natures are evil, and oppoſit to the Salvation of Mens Souls, and which though they ſhould permit them, would nevertheleſs continue and remain ſins, and exclude them that do and practice them from obtaining Salvation. And of ſuch a Nature are many
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:179814:45"/>Popiſh Doctrins <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And certainly thoſe Princes are moſt worthy of the praiſe of God and Men, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to remove ſuch Abuſes, and all things forbidden by God, which remaining make it impoſſible for men to be ſaved, or if ſaved, yet ſo as by Fire, very difficultly. But in things not repugnant to the will of God, all Princes have liberty to do that which the good and weal of their State requires.</p>
            <p>I appeal to all the <hi>Caeſars</hi> in the World; nay to all mankind, if it be reaſonable, that the requital of the good Services of particular perſons ſhould be gratified with the vacating, or but ſuſpending thoſe Laws which are our ſtrongeſt ſecurity, or ſhould be debarred from making yet ſtronger Laws againſt But chering and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous men and Principles. This State ſeeks not your Blood, it only deſires to be ſecured and ſafe from thoſe deſtructive dangers,, unto which Popiſh Doctrins, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and principles do moſt manifeſtly expoſe it; againſt which no perfect ſecurity can poſſibly be given, but by as publick condemnation and deteſtation of them, as they are ratified by, (1) by Popes, Councils. Decrees, great and learned men, Abjurations, and the like.</p>
            <p>And I appeal yet further to all the World, if our Popiſh Traytors here have not in defiance of our Laws, and for their Juſtification, Honour and Encouragement been rewarded at <hi>Rome</hi> with Honours and Offices, made Holy Martyrs, Canonized for Saints, and their very Bones kept for Reliques: Mighty Motives I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to perſwade us to reward and tollerate ſuch men, and ſuch a Religion. A Religon that no Proteſtant (I might go farther) can embrace without becoming worſe than bruitiſh, by unreaſoning themſelves out of

            <p>All which ſeriouſly conſidered, and that though Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrates have power moderately, and in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by wholſom Laws (not by Fire and Faggot, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Inquiſitions) to compel, and to ſecure the true Religion and undefiled, and their Realms profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame; yet I find no warrant <hi>in Bibliis Sacris</hi> for any power to tollerate and indulge any falſe Religion in their Dominions.</p>
            <p>§ Concerning which I ſhall ſay thus in general, That though no mortal man hath rightful power to forbid Chriſts Spiritual Duties. the Worſhipping of God, Preaching his Word and Truth; yet I ſay firſt, that no Indulgence ought to be given by the Magiſtrate to any Sect whatſoever, whoſe Doctrins and Principles are not known, and therefore none to Quakers or Enthuſiaſts, whoſe Rule is not the Scripture, but the Light within them, which is darkneſs to others, if not to themſelves, and it may be <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to day, and yet <hi>Crucifige</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Then the Principles, by which other Sects do
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179814:47"/>worſhip, being known, the legiſlative Magiſtrares, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monarchs, or Free States, are the Judges of them, how conſiſtent or inconſiſtent with Gods true Religion and Worſhip, and with the peace and wellfare of their own Dominions and Subjects, and accordingly may, or may not Indulge or Tollerate their Religion and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>And therefore Princes ought to uſe great Caution, and to be very wary and circumſpect herein, for that ſins committed by others through our Example, Inſtigation, Connivnace or Tolleration, become ours by <hi>juſt Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> In <hi>Naboths death,</hi> the <hi>Judges and falſe Witneſſes</hi> were the next <hi>Agents, Jeſabel</hi> the <hi>Plotter</hi> only, and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigator,</hi> 1 King. 21.7, 13, 23. Yet ſhe is puniſhed for ſhedding <hi>Naboths Blood,</hi> though her hand was not upon him: Even in Courts of ordinary Juſtice it ſeems juſt, and is ſo in our Law, that not only the <hi>Executioner,</hi> but the <hi>Plotter, Abettor, Inſtigator,</hi> and <hi>Concealer</hi> of Treaſon, be puniſhed with death: Yea, ſee how far a leſs degree of participation brings guilt upon our Souls: The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> that but tollerated the breach of the Sabbath, are charged to have <hi>prophaned the Sabbath,</hi> Nehem. 13.17.18. Yea the leaſt Countenance given to Idolatry, makes culpable of Idolatry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18, 21. To this agrees the Prohibition of St. <hi>Paul, Communicate not with other Mens ſins,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.22.

After this was granted in Words, the Emperors Ambaſſador deſired ſome Teſtimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe under the Great Seal, which being denied, he deſired to have it by a Letter; which was alſo denyed, but not without ſhewing ſound reaſon, that he perceiving it to be

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:179814:55"/>Magiſtrates; yet would ſhe for ſo great Princes ſakes deal favourably with them, though not without ſome offence to her own Subjects: But to grant them Churches wherein to celebrate their divine Offices apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhe could not with the ſafety of the Common-Wealth, and without wrong to her ovvn Honour and Conſcience; neither vvas there any cauſe vvhy ſhe ſhould grant them, ſeeing <hi>England</hi> embraced no nevv or ſtrange Doctrin, but the ſame vvhich Chriſt commanded, the Primitive, and Catholick Church received, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers vvith one Mind and Voice approved, and to allovv Churches with contrary Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; Beſides that, it openly repugned the Lawseſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Authority of Parliament, were nothing elſe but to ſow Religion out of Religion, to diſtract good Mens minds, to cheriſh factious Mens humours, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb Religion, and the Common-Wealth, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Divine and Humane things, a Thing, Evil in Deed, but in Example worſt of all, to her own good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects hurtful, and unto themſelves, to whom it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither greatly commodious, nor yet at all ſafe: She was therefore determined out of her natural Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and eſpecially at their requeſt to be willing to <hi>heale the private inſolency of a few,</hi> by much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance, yet ſo as ſhe might not encourage their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate minds by her Indulgence.</q>

            <p>§ <q>When <hi>Suſſex</hi> treated with the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> on the Articles of Marriage between Arch-Duke <hi>Charles</hi> his Son, and Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> both Father and Son did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, That a publick Church might be allowed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Divine Service might be celebrated to him and his, after the <hi>Romiſh</hi> manner: When this would not be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:179814:55"/>granted, then that in ſome private place in the Court he might peaceably uſe his Service of God, (as was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Popiſh Princes Ambaſſadors</hi> in their Houſes) and that with theſe Conditions, That no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man ſhould be admitted thereunto, and neither he, nor his Servants ſhould ſpeak againſt the Religion received in <hi>England,</hi> or favour thoſe that did ſpeak againſt it: That if any diſpleaſure ſhould ariſe in reſpect of Religion, he ſhould be preſent with the Queen at Divine Service, to be celebrated after the manner of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Unto this the Queen anſwered, That if ſhe ſhould grant this, ſhe ſhould offend her Conſcience, and openly break the publick Laws of her Realm, not without great peril both of her dignity and ſafety. The ſame Princely, Pious, and immovable Reſolution ſhe held, when in the like Treaty of Marriage between her and the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> where Tolleration of the Roman Religion being much preſſed and inſiſted on, both by the Queen his Mother, and by <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> his Brother, Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> (though it were ſuggeſted, that the Romiſh Religion was not deeply rooted in the Dukes mind, being but young, and for that he was Educated under <hi>Carnlette,</hi> a perſon not averſe from the Proteſtant Religion, and that by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he might be brought to the Proteſtant profeſſion; and many other and great advantages would thereby accrew to the good of the Reformed Religion) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, (as well became Gods Vice-gerent in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions) That although the outward Exerciſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion might haply be tollerated with different Rites and Ceremonies amongſt the Subjects of one and the ſame Kingdom; yet a different, yea a flat contrary
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:179814:56"/>Exerciſe between the Queen (who is the Head of her people) and her Husband, might not only ſeem peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but alſo altogether abſurd; ſhe prayed them to conſider with equal Ballance, on the one ſide her own hazard, and on the other ſide the Duke of <hi>Anjou's</hi> Honour: By Tollerating his Religion, ſhe ſhould break the Laws eſtabliſhed, give offence to her beſt Subjects, and encouragement to her worſt; which things would certainly over-weigh the Duke of <hi>Anjou's</hi> Honour: If the Duke would water more plentifully the Seeds of the purer Religion, already ſown, and ſuffer more to be ſown, he ſhould ſoon ſee, that it would be unto him a moſt high Honour. At length it came to this Iſſue, That if ſo be the Duke would be preſent with the Queen, at the Celebration of Divine Service, and not refuſe to hear and learn the <hi>Inſtitutions of the Proteſtant Religion;</hi> ſhe would aſſent, that neither the <hi>Duke</hi> nor his Family ſhould be conſtraned to uſe the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor moleſted for other Divine Rites, not openly and manifeſtly repugnant to <hi>Gods Word</hi> ſo as it were done in a certain private place, and no occaſion given to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to break the Laws eſtabliſhed. <hi>Foix</hi> ſtuck at the Word, the <hi>WOrd of God;</hi> for whoſe ſatisfaction the <hi>Queen</hi> commanded inſtead of <hi>Gods Word</hi> to put in <hi>Gods Church,</hi> which when it liked him worſe, and for it would have had to be put in the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> flatly and ſtoutly refuſed it, and ſo by degrees it cooled. Her religious care herein was alſo ſo great and ſteady, that <hi>Walſing ham</hi> her <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> had ſecret Inſtructions, That if the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> ſhould be content to omit in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that point concerning <hi>Tolleration of Religion,</hi> yet
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:179814:56"/>would the <hi>Queen</hi> bind him in ſuch ſure caution, that he ſhould not require it at any time after.</q>
            </p>
            <p>§ Of the ſame opinion was <hi>King James Anno</hi> 1596. in the Caſe of <hi>Huntley Angus,</hi> and <hi>Arrol,</hi> Popiſh Lords, who though they would have betrayed the Kingdom to the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> yet the King being willing afterwards to have them return, (though Guilt had made them Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) and being returned, the King writ thus to <hi>Huntley, viz.</hi> 
               <q>My Lord, I am ſure you conſider, and do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how often I have incurred Skaith and hazard for your cauſe; therefore to be ſhort, reſolve you either to ſatisfie the Church betwixt that day that is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without any more delay, or elſe if your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be ſo Kittle, as it cannot permit you, make for another Land betwixt this and that day, where you may uſe freely your own Conſcience, your Wife and Barnes ſhall in that Caſe enjoy your Living, but for your ſelf look never to be a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Man again; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not your ſelf to think by lingring of time your Wife, and your Allys, ſhall ever get you better Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And think not, that I will ſuffer any profeſſing a contrary Religion to dwell in this Land.</q>

            <p>Afterwards when His Majeſty came to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which was <hi>May</hi> 14. 1602. he declared to his Parliament there 19. <hi>May</hi> 1603.<note place="margin">Li. c. p. <hi>1</hi>

It is you, not we, that keep back half the Communion one of the Commandments, and the publick uſe of the Scripture, the very Rule and Guide to Salvation.</p>
            <p>§ It grieves you ſore, that any of your Tribe ſhould be invited againſt their Wills to frequent our Sacraments or Service,<note place="margin">As lawful for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as Papiſts to compel.</note> and that any mans Conſcience ſhould be forced: Then why did you force Numbers with extream violence to recant, and forſwear the perſwaſion of their Faith? <hi>What Reaſon can you bring that you may compel others, and none must compel you?

This kind of compelling which Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> uſed, and our Laws ſtill preſcribe, cannot be denyed to be Charitable, and to be reſembleable to that Coaction, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:179814:60"/>commend in <hi>Joſiah,</hi> which the moſt virtuous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours followed in the Primitive Church, and which St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> upon deep debating the cauſe, found allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himſelf as the chiefeſt point of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which he requireth of Chriſtian Princes. As much as they are troubled with Compulſion, when it is uſed againſt themſelves, yet they can glory in it when they uſe it againſt others; Witneſs <hi>Peter Dameſius</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Ambaſſador to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who in his ſolemn Oration to that Synod, vapoured, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had never ſuffered any Sect in any part of <hi>France,</hi> nor any but Catholicks; yea, have procured the converſion of Strangers, Idolaters and Hereticks, and have conſtrained them with pious Arms to profeſs the true and ſound Religion, <hi>(rectius Hereſie.)</hi> He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how <hi>Childibert</hi> compelled the <hi>Viſigothes</hi> (who were <hi>Arrians</hi>) to joyn themſelves to the Catholick Church; and how <hi>Charles</hi> the Great made Wars 30 Years with the <hi>Saxons</hi> to reduce them to Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Conſ.

Our Sacraments, Service and Sermons, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to the <hi>Conſtat</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Will</hi> and <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and therefore ought to be uſed and frequented, and perſons may be compelled to frequent them.</p>
            <p>To come yet nearer home, &amp; unto our own days; What are the perſecutions of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> &amp; <hi>Hungarians</hi> at this day, but Compulſions, &amp; thoſe contrary to ſeveral Edicts, Agreements and Sanctions of their Princes, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (beſides their juſt right derived from God himſelf) become their juſt due, and ought as Inviolably to be kept as well on the Princes as on the Subjects part. God never brake his Covenant made with his people; and Princes ought as ſolemnly in this to Imitate their God,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:179814:60"/>and their Lord, whoſe Vice-gerents they are, and ought not to tranſgreſs or go beyond their Commiſſion. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this kind can ever be claimed from, or object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſtly againſt our Proteſtant Kings or Parliaments. I will not look far back, nor mention thoſe ſolemn curſed Oaths ſome of our European Princes have taken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and extirpate Hereticks, <hi>i. e.</hi> Proteſtants Root and Branch.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here only call to mind the Edicts of <hi>Nantez</hi> made by <hi>H.</hi> 4. as a particular Irrevocable fundamental Law. In purſuance whereof Commiſſioners were ſent into all Provinces to execute the ſame, which being done in due form, the Commiſſioners returned the Execution thereof into the Hands of the King to ſerve as a Rule and Standard in all future Debates which might happily ariſe on that Subject. Now to tell of all the violations of this Edict at the Inſtigation of the Jeſuitical Clergy would fill a Volume, therefore I ſhall ſtint it to a few of many.</p>
            <p>New Commiſſioners ſince 1660 being Commiſſioned, are commanded to Execute the Acts of Council made in Conſequence of that Edict, which are no other than ſo many violations of the ſame. The Council <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. paſt an Act, that the Proteſtants ſhall not be admitted before the Commiſſioners to prove the right for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Religion by Inqueſts or Witneſſes, even although the Witneſſes be Roman Catholicks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have loſt near Three parts of Four of all their Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provence,</hi> which had 15 or 16. Churches, is now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to 4. <hi>Grex</hi> which had 23 Churches hath now but 2. In all <hi>Bretaigne</hi> remains but 2. High and low <hi>Languedock</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:179814:61"/>are reduced to half their Number. <hi>Poictu</hi> which had 61 indiſputable Churches, is now reduced to 13. by an Act of 6. <hi>August</hi> 1665. and ſo of divers other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>By which means the Proteſtant Religion ſuffers more than by any Pariſian Veſpers: The Proteſtants being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated either to live without any publick Exerciſe of their Religion, or through infinite dangers and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiencies to wander 50. or 60. Miles diſtant from them.</p>
            <p>One Act of Council hath robbed them of the liberty of praiſing God by forbidding ſinging of Pſalms, even privately in their Hhouſes. <hi>May</hi> 6. 1659. <hi>March</hi> 17. 1663.</p>
            <p>Another Act hath deprived them of the comfort of paying their laſt duty to their Dead with any conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency; compelling them to bury clandeſtinely, and in the night. In humanity beyond that of Heathens. 7. <hi>Aug. &amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1662.</p>
            <p>Another hath diveſted Proteſtant Magiſtrates, what ever be their charge or quality of the priviledge of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in their Courts. <hi>Soct.</hi> 1663.</p>
            <p>Another hath taken away all means of Inſtructing and Educating cheir Children, leaving them at moſt (and that only in ſome places) the ſmaller Schools, where is only taught to Write, Read, Compt; as if ſtudy of Religion were incompatible with the ſtudy of Humane Sciences. 26. <hi>Eeb.</hi> 1663.</p>
            <p>Another hath reſtrained the liberty of Printing any Book in favour of the Religion without obtaining an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primatur</hi> from the Kings Council, and how likely they are to obtain that is not hard to gueſs. 29. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1663.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:179814:61"/>
            <p> Another ordaineth Parents to give Penſions to their Children who turn Papiſts, although the Children will not dwell with them. <hi>Declaration</hi> 24. <hi>Oct.</hi> 1663. <hi>and Acts of Council</hi> 30. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1665. As if paternal Authority were nulled by Childrens Apoſtacy; forgetting, that Chriſtian Religion doth not abſolve Slaves from their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their Maſters, yet <hi>Dominus Deus vester Papa</hi> can diſcharge Children of their obedience which they owe to their Parents of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>Another prohibits the Exerciſe of Charity towards their Brethren, who have no ſufficiency of their own for their livelyhood. 5. <hi>Oct.</hi> 1663.</p>
            <p>Another diſchargeth payment of Debts by thoſe of the Commonalty who ſhall turn Papiſts. The very Heathens never pretended that thoſe Chriſtians who did but Apoſtatize to them, ſhould be diſcharged from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Debts.</p>
            <p>Another prohibits Miniſters to preach without the place of their reſidence, thereby depriving them of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Annexation, <hi>i. e.</hi> the priviledge of one Miniſters ſupplying Two Churches, which ſingly are not able to afford a compleat maintenance. 22. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1664.</p>
            <p>Another giveth liberty to Prieſts and Fryars to enter their Houſes, and come unto their Bed-ſides when ſick or dying to ſollicite them to change their Religion 18. <hi>Sept.</hi> 1664. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>May</hi> 1665.</p>
            <p>Another maketh it criminal in Miniſters to ſtyle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Paſtors or Miniſters of the Word of God. Nay, they have regulated the very Garments of Miniſters; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them to wear a long Garment, that they may have no Character of diſtinction from the peaſants. 30. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1663.</p>

A thing plainly contrary to the Edict: Yet they have given it a retroſpective and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troactive power to execute it againſt perſons who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of the Religion long before the Declaration was in being; and accordingly have proceeded againſt ſome whom they have impriſoned, compelled to do penance (by going Bare-foot and Bare-headed through the ſtreets with a burning Torch to the place of Juſtice, or perſon offended, and there to ask forgiveneſs) and then Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Kingdom.</p>

And this I ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in point of fact, by inſtancing of ſome few of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of the better ſort, (for of the more ordinary ſort they were <hi>ſans nombre</hi>) not unfit to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; as by name Dr. <hi>Heth,</hi> that was <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, who at the firſt coming of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> to the Crown, ſhewing himſelf a faithful and quiet Subject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in both the ſaid Offices, though in Religion then manifeſtly differing, and was not reſtrained of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nor deprived of his proper Lands and Goods; but willingly leaving both his Offices, lived in his own Houſe very diſcreetly, and injoyed all his purchaſed Lands, and diſpoſd of them as he pleaſed at his death: An Example of Clemency not to be parallel'd in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> time.

Beſides theſe Eccleſiaſticks, there were alſo very many Lay-men of good Fortunes and Families that were manifeſtly <hi>ſeduced by their Prieſts</hi> to hold wrong opinions in Religion for the Popes Authority, and none of them were ever impeached of Treaſon, or of low of Life, Member, or Inheritance, for ſuch their opinions in Religion, or for the Popes Authority alone, as our moſt impudent Adverſaries have often publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">F. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> and yet ſome of them were well known to hold opinion, That the Pope ought by Authority of Gods Word to be Supreme, and only Head of the Catholick Church over the whole World, and only to rule in all Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical; and that the <hi>Queens Majeſty</hi> ought not to be Governour over any of her Subjects in her Realm, being perſons Eccleſiaſtical; which opinions are
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179814:64"/>nevertheleſs in ſome part by the Laws of this Nation pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable in other Degrees; yet for none of theſe points were any perſons proſecuted with the Crime of Treaſon, or brought in danger of life, but enjoyed their Religion in private with Connivance, though not with Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Abetting, and ſo they have done ever ſince even unto the very day this Dialogiſt writ his Dialogue, with as much freedom and liberty: Nay, with more, than have our other diſſenting Brethren, (who differ in Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Eccleſiaſtical Government only, not in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin) without having their Conſciences raked into by <hi>Six bloody Articles,</hi> or any Oaths: And if any thing of more than ordinary ſeverity hath lately befallen them, they may thank their own moſt implacable and reſtleſs Spirits for it: And if any of the ſame Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of more quiet, and moderate Temper and Humour, and better principled, do ſuffer thereby, they ought in all Juſtice to do as the Seculars in <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> days did, and place the blame on the fiery tempers of that <hi>Crudele genus</hi> of ſome their own Colleagues that have brought this upon them, and not to blame us or our Laws, who in all prudence ought to provide for the ſafety and quiet of our ſelves and of our own Religion by wholſom Laws, be diſpleaſed therewith who will.</p>
            <p>Now were Papiſts in <hi>Queen Eliz</hi> days the quieter or better Subjects for thoſe 12 Years Indulgence, Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, Favours and princely Graces? or the <hi>Queen</hi> in any manner the more ſecure in her perſon, or quiet in her Dominions? Let be Judg that <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> together with the Popes Commiſſion granted to Dr. <hi>Sanders</hi> as Legate, (who before his paſſing into <hi>Ireland</hi> openly by writing, Impudently avowed that <hi>Bull</hi> againſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:179814:65"/>
               <hi>Her Majeſty</hi> to be lawful, and which for ought I know is in force to this day againſt all her Succeſſors, (if any Pope pleaſe to have it ſo) and together with the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties granted by the Pope unto <hi>P.

               <note place="margin">25. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1570.</note> 
               <hi>and a ſufficient diſcharge of her Subjects fidelity, and ſo remaineth in force; but in ſome points touching her Subjects it is altered by the preſent Pope. For where in that Bull all her Subjects are commanded not to obey her, and ſhe being Excommunicate and Depoſed, all that do obey her are likewiſe innodate and Accurſed, which point is perilous to the Catholicks; for if they obey her, they are within the verge of the Popes Curſe; if they diſobey her, they are in the Queens danger; therefore the preſent Pope to relieve them hath altered that part of the</hi> Bull, <hi>and diſpenſed with them to obey or ſerve her without peril of Excommunication, which Diſpenſation is to endure but till it pleaſe the Pope otherwiſe to determine.</hi> We thank his Holineſs. This <hi>Bull</hi> did Import, 1. That Her Majeſty was not the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the firſt and higheſt point of Traſon. 2. That all her Subjects are diſcharged of all their Oaths and Obedience; another point of high Treaſon. 3. All warranted to diſobey her and her Laws.</p>
            <p>This was the proper and natural product of 12 Years Indulgence and Connivance with much moderation, and many favours; and from this Root ſprang all the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179814:65"/>Treaſons (in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> days, and ſince, and will be again if not prevented) of <hi>Northumberland, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland, Parſons, Parry, Throgmorton, Somervile, Stewke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Saunders, cum multis aliis.</hi> A ſpecial Argument and Motive I muſt confeſs (and well becoming <hi>P.</hi> the Dialogiſt, when he hath no better) to perſwade King and Parliament to give new and freſh Indulgence to the Papiſts, that they might with the better Grace, and more Authority <hi>impune peccare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to this pitiful begging Argument of this <hi>P. viz.</hi> That becauſe many of them deny much of the Popes Authority; therefore they ſhould have Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration now; I ſhall only apply matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> the chiefeſt and moſt of them that I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, had in the times of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and <hi>E.</hi> 6. either by preaching, writing, reading or arguing, taught all people to condemn, yea to abhor the Authority of the Pope; for which purpoſe they had many times given their Oaths publickly againſt the Popes Authority, and had alſo yielded to both the ſaid Kings the Title of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> next under Chriſt, and yet they refuſed to allow Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Title of <hi>Supreme Governor,</hi> though to gratifie them ſhe omitted the very Title of <hi>Supreme Head</hi> at the begin of her Reign, and this is demonſtrable by many of their Books and Sermons againſt the Popes Authority printed both in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> to their great ſhame and reproach to change ſo often, but eſpecially in perſecuting ſuch in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, whom themſelves had taught and eſtabliſhed to hold the contrary in <hi>H.</hi> 8. days; a ſin bordering on the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſcarce to be forgiven. And
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:179814:66"/>ſhall we be gull'd again by ſuch Sophiſters. Was Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> ever the more ſafe in her perſon? or her Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the more ſecure from Troubles, Inſurrections, or Rebellions, becauſe ſome few proteſted Loyalty? Let all Impartial Hiſtories, and their and our own Memories be Judg.

            <p>But why trouble I my ſelf, or the Readers with this frivolous Argument, when it cannot be the leaſt duſt in the Ballance to perſwade? That upon this Dialogiſt, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or only Intimation rather, he and his Seculars (and who thoſe are we know not, and not poſſible for us to diſtinguiſh) ſhall uſe loyal and peaceable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours; nay, what if they ſhould be as good as their Word, deny the Popes Exorbitant powers, and ſwear Allegiance maugre the Popes Mandates to the contrary? Is this an Argument prevalent enough to perſwade us to nurſe and nuzzle up the Popes Imps, (whoſe Seeds-men and Legates are both Prieſts and Jeſuits) and ſuffer him that hath already curſed Her Majeſties perſon, and in her all her Succeſſors, removed her Crown, diſcharged her Subjects, invaded here Dominions,<note n="*" place="margin">

I do heartily joyn Iſſue with this Dialogiſt, and believe as he doth, <hi>That it is not for the ſafety of our Church to receive thoſe who do not believe as we do.</hi> In this we are good Friends; but I doubt he will be as angry with me, as with the ſeaſonable diſcourſer, for accounting the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion to be Superſtitious, Idolatrous and Abſurd; and the Proteſtant to be the True, Antient, and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion: Neither ſhall I much differ with him in ſome other of his Conceſſions, <hi>viz.

            <p>In all Hiſtories from Generation to Generation, they that run may read prodigious Examples of Exorbitant <hi>Papal Claims</hi> and pride over <hi>Kings, Emperours, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Free States,</hi> even againſt right reaſon, and to the Indignation of all Mankind, and theſe juſtified by their <hi>Popes, Councils, Decretals, Canons</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> of the firſt Magnitude, aſcribing to the Pope power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Kings, if Hereticks, and they are all ſo, when

            <p>And if yet there be any <hi>Papiſts</hi> that in Word, or Writings do diſown ſuch Doctrins as the Seculars did in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> days, <hi>(of whom notwithſtanding it is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That they never diſcovered any traiterous deſign until it was first diſcovered by others, and that in ſeveral Treaſons, though many of the Seminary Prieſts were active and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)</hi> yet they are as little to be confided in, as thoſe that own and juſtifie them; for that by ſo doing they contradict and diſclaim the very Faith they own and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; and unto which they are ſworn, thereby forſaking their <hi>Popes, Councils, Canons, Divines,</hi> and <hi>Decretals;</hi> nay, their Doctrins of Supremacy, of believing as the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> as the Pope believes of <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> of Equivocation, of no Faith to be kept with Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all Doctrins of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which alone are in their eſteem, of power ſufficient to warrant and juſtifie their blind obedience, and to <hi>null all the ſecurity</hi> that can poſſibly be given between Prince &amp; People, whether Oaths or Laws, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, nay Divine.</p>
            <p>And if we may prognoſticate of practiſes to come, by practiſes paſt let the ſaid Experience of former Ages, and of all Countries, and of ours in particular, riſe up in Judgment againſt them, that they never have been, never will be Loyal Subjects to our Proteſtant Princes the Reaſons are ſtrong, for that they are ever incited to ſuch evil Machinations and practiſes by the <hi>ſtrong impulſe and impetuous zeal of their own Doctrins and Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and all proceeding from <hi>cauſes pecular unto Romiſh
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:179814:70"/>Religion and Principles,</hi> which they have not in the leaſt as yet changed, nor diſclaimed, nor yet their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>§ Beſides, if the Papiſts of <hi>England</hi> have merited any thing from the King and his Father in theſe late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>it is no thanks to their Religion;</hi> and therefore no reaſon they ſhould be gratified in their <hi>Religion;</hi> for had it proceeded from the undoubted principles of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it would have held as well in <hi>Ireland</hi> as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> nay, it would have held as well in <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths,</hi> and <hi>King James</hi> his time, as in the time of <hi>King Charles</hi> Father and Son.<note n="a" place="margin">Poſtſcript to an Anſwer to a Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gent. and alſo in a ſparing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> It being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by themſelves, that none of them have in all the times of perſecution dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expreſly for Religion, but all for Treaſon.<note n="b" place="margin">Anſwer to a Letter to a Jeſuited Gent. <hi>f. 45.</hi>
               </note> And that <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts would have been as little Loyal to <hi>Queen Mary</hi> as unto <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> But the continual Plots againſt the Life and Crown of that <hi>Queen;</hi> and that horrid <hi>Gun-powder</hi> Plot againſt <hi>King James,</hi> and all his Race and Nobles; and the late <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt <hi>King Charles</hi> do demonſtrate the contrary, and their Religion, where that and the Pope are concerned, teaching the contrary; but they thought not their Religion in that caſe concerned, if they had, then it would have appeared, whether their Loyalty would have born up againſt it or no, more than it hath done in former times. Therefore if any ſuch Merits have been, they have been only perſonal, and ſo may be, and no doubt ſo have been, and will be requited with perſonal favours, but in no caſe, with ſuch as may tend to the advantage of the <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and conſequently to the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:179814:71"/>diſadvantage of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> Power and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of our Princes.</p>
            <p>But let us a little examin what in truth have been the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Papists</hi> in the late Wars. To ſay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts were the Formal Cauſes of the late War upon what hath been before written, were happily not quite beſides the Cuſhion. However, the former matter and grounds adminiſters good Reaſons to believe, and affirm that they were <hi>great occaſions</hi> both of the <hi>riſe, growth</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi> of our late Wars. Some, and thoſe not a few, of the wiſeſt and moſt ſober <hi>Cavaliers</hi> thought that the <hi>Papists</hi> did look upon the War as their great <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Hahveſt,</hi> either by opening unto them occaſions to pretend ſomething in favour of their party in caſe the King prevailed; or otherwiſe by fomenting of the War between Proteſtant and Proteſtant, they ſhould have gained an Intereſt through their diviſioos, when they had weakened one another, and that by fiſhing in troubled Waters they ſhould gain ſome advantage by the confuſions, which (as the Law ſtood) in a ſetled State of Affairs they could not expect.</p>
            <p>§. However, if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> did not deſign thoſe diviſions, and the breaking in pieces of the Antient Government of this Kingdom, and that wherein they hoped to find their Intereſt; it is certain they were great occaſions thereof; for what on the one hand with their Negotiations before the War by <hi>Seignior Con,</hi> and other the <hi>Popes Agents,</hi> and the State tampering with the Pope and King of <hi>Spain</hi> about the <hi>INfanta,</hi> not yet out of the Minds and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Subjects; and their boldneſs upon the favour they might happily expect from the Kings Mother, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:179814:71"/>the Clemency which they found from his Father, (no way deſirous to have the Sanguinary Laws Executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) and what by the Rebellion of thoſe of that Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they created ſo great Jealouſies in the minds of the Proteſtant party in <hi>England,</hi> that it rather weakened the Royal party than fortified it, and made the Adverſe party ſo numerous and ſo ſucceſsful as a long time it was. And it may be truly ſaid there was never a Papiſt in the Kings Army, but it loſt him the Hearts of many Proteſtants; and as it cannot be ſuppoſed, that they brought a Bleſſing on the Kings Armies, ſo it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they brought a very ill reputation upon them; and where one fought againſt the Kings party upon a ſerious Examination of the State of the Quarrel, Hundreds took the other party, becauſe they ſaw ſo many Papiſts on his ſide; and poſſibly things had never grown to that height, as to have broken out into a War, had it not been for the Jealouſies which were partly given, and partly taken from the Inſolent Carriage of that party both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And yet for all this, and that they were ſo much concerned to quench the fire, that had ſo far contributed to the kindling of it, we ſhall find as little ground for their Wroks of Super-errogation in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in point of Religion; if the number of them that were ſlain, or ſuffered for the King or his Father be compared with the Proteſtant profeſſion: Neither were they ſo Inſtrumental to the reſtitution of the King as thoſe of the Proteſtant profeſſion, no not as very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that had formerly been of the contrary ſide, and even where Intereſt might ſeem more to ſway them another way, and that in all probability might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves more favour under the powers that then
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:179814:72"/>prevaled; for that is alſo conſiderable in that matter, (which was pleaded by many of the <hi>Papists</hi> to obtain favour from the powers that were from time to time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, when they were ſo) that could they have lived quietly in their own Houſes, they had never repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Kings Garriſons. But the War being held forth (to gain more credit to the party) to be againſt Papiſts and their Adherents chiefly, though all ſorts of gther opinions found ſome Indulgence, yet the Papiſts (profeſſing themſelves Papiſts) could not be admitted upon any tearms, though happily they were admitted; nay favoured under diſguiſes of Quakers, and the like; and therefore no marvel if they were on the Kings ſide, that they might play their Game the better on both ſides, when they could not be on the other ſide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly.</p>
            <p>§ The Truth is, prudence and neceſſity together, with their Loyalty, made them ſerve the King in his Wars, they well knowing that the Parliament was profeſſedly and deſperately bent againſt them; and therefore could have little hopes of comfort from them, which Induced them to adhere to the Kiug, who was <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and from whom they might juſtly challenge protection, as <hi>Subjects,</hi> though not as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in which capacity His Majeſty received them; neither did he ever own their aſſiſtance, but as Subjects, and as juſtified by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
            <p>And now that the differing parties being weary of endleſs Broyls, were willing to come to a Cloſure; thoſe that had done ſo much to occaſion the War, and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to make it ſucceſsful, and leſs to bring about His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties happy return, and union between him and his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:179814:72"/>people, would make ſuch a vertue of neceſſity, as to deſerve ſuch Indulgences and Rewards, which neither can be expected with modeſty, nor granted with a good Conſcience towards God, no nor yet with ſafety to the Crown, if the Intrinſick Intereſt thereof be juſtly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſidered, and without all Colour or Ground of Reaſon, Conſcience or prudence: For indeed all things, principles and practiſes conſidered, I cannot I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine what good and indefeaſable ſecurity they can poſſibly give to any Proteſtant Prince or State, that they will be and continue Loyal and Faithful Subjects: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore until they reverſe and nullifie their <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> their claims and pretenſions of Juriſdiction over Temporal Princes, their Doctrins of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and of <hi>blind Obedience;</hi> nay, their Doctrins of <hi>probability</hi> alſo they muſt excuſe me, if I differ in opinion with them, and make it an Article of my Creed, and believe, that no proteſtant Prince or State can ever be undoubtedly ſecure of the Loyalty and Fidelity of their Popiſh Subjects, if the Pope command the contrary: It being according to their Doctrin of <hi>probability,</hi> a Maxim amongſt them, that that which 1, 2. or ſome few Roman Catholick Doctors ſay is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, may (in the Judgment of Papiſts) be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mortal ſin.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Having thus Summarily manifeſted to all the World, that will read and underſtand the Doctrins and practiſes of Papiſts to be ſo deſperately pernicious and deſtructive to our Proteſtant Kings and Kingdoms; and withall will conſider what moſt precious Golden Aples <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with all their Forrein plantations and Dominions, are to gratifie <hi>Cardinaliſme, Nepotiſme,</hi> or any inceſtuous Brood of any <hi>Donna Olympia.</hi> It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonable to believe, That what they have done, that they will re-iterate again and again, if not wiſely and timely prevented; were it not then admiral diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us to give this Generation of Men yet more power and liberty (the only things they want) to put the ſame practiſes in Execution again, when they have given us from Age to Age ſucceſſively ſuch Demonſtrations and Aſſurances, that they will do as they have done when
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:179814:73"/>ever they have power, a neat opportunity, and are ſo commanded by their univerſal Monarch?</p>
            <p>But I Conclude, That if we have any love or regard for that Religion, which is <hi>pure, peaceable, undefiled,</hi> and which is truly <hi>Antient, Catholick,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick;</hi> or any abhorrency to that Inchanting City full of all pollutions &amp; uncleaneſs, Idolatry, Superſtition, Blaſphemy, what not? or any concern for the ſafety of His Majeſties perſon, for liberty of our Conſciences, property and freedom of our Eſtates, and laſtly any care to preſerve King and Kingdom from <hi>Pariſian Veſpers,</hi> Inquiſitions, Fire and Faggot, and from a <hi>Six-knotted-whip</hi> of <hi>Articles;</hi> it will wonderfully concern us by all wholſom Laws and means to prevent the growth of this <hi>Crudele Genus,</hi> by paring their Nayls only, that otherwiſe would crack our Crowns, and ſeek our lives, unleſs we will <hi>quantum in nobis,</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice once more all that is near and dear unto us, unto Romiſh Tyranny.</p>
            <p>§ I ſhall yet further Conclude, That if Proteſtant Princes will but rightly conſider that they (like Gods own Sabbath) were ordained for Kingdoms, and not Kingdoms for them, and that if they will follow but the very Dictates of right Reaſon, and the very light of Nature, they cannot (without being <hi>felones de ſe</hi>) eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, or tollerate by Law Popery in their Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: For as ſelf-preſervation by the very Law and Light of Nature is the <hi>Suprema lex</hi> of every Individual, and conſequently of every Prince conſidered only as a ſingle perſon: So <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> (wherein the Prince himſelf is alſo included and involved) even politically, and in reſpect of Magiſtracy conſidered is the <hi>Suprema lex</hi> alſo; And the firſt and principal thing Magiſtrates
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:179814:74"/>are to look after, is to preſerve Magiſtracy, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorty they are intruſted withall for the good of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, in its full power and prerogative: And for this great reaſon alſo it is wonderful abſurd to ſuppoſe a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate obliged to tollerate any thing deſtructive to the very being of the perſons, and Authority of him and his people, for whoſe wellfare he is intruſted: And of ſuch a Nature is Popery, and is the deſign of Papiſts, and no pretence of Conſcience whatſoever is in ſuch a Caſe to be hearkned unto; or endured, it being againſt the very Light of Nature, and in truth nothing elſe but to pretend Conſcience, the better to enable them to deſtroy not Religion only, but even Proteſtant Mankind: For the very Light of Nature abandons all ſuch principles from the leoſt Tolleration, they making men ceaſe to be true Subjects to the State, or good Common-Walths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in relation to others.</p>
            <p>Though I have thus juſtified the Act of Parliament by the confeſſions of Papiſts themſelves, by matters of Fact, Reaſons of State, and warranty of Scripture; yet I can give no Vote or Encouragement for Sanguinary Laws, meerly for matters of Religion abſtract from trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and capital crimes and practiſes; nor yet to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our Adverſaries in Inquiſitions, fleaing with Stripes, ſtarving with Hunger, Cold and Nakedneſs, plunging into loathſom Dungeons, full fraught with ſtinking Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and with Toads, Serpents, and other venomous Creatures; nor yet for unneceſſary pecuniary Mulcts. And I am confident, that ſuch true <hi>Engliſh</hi> generous Blood runs in the Veins of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliaments, that they naturally pity the diſtreſſed, and abhor cruelties, that they will not uſe Extremities, not put in Execution
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:179814:74"/>the utmoſt of the Penal Laws, but will mould them as gently as the peace and ſafety of the Nation will bear and permit. And I am verily perſwaded, That if their over buſie and fiery Prieſts had not been over Active, the Review and Revival of any ſeverities againſt them had never been thought of, and if any new Acts do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, it is but what they have brought upon themſelves, and for which none may be blamed but themſelves, and their Layety only, becauſe they ſuffer themſelves to be led blind-fold by their Noſes by them who have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo to do, for which they are much, very much to be commiſerated, there being a vaſt difference between the Seducers and Seduced.</p>
            <p>But if any more ſevere Laws than other ought to be put in Execution, certainly they ought to be inflicted on <hi>Idolaters</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemers.</hi> That the Papiſts are <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters</hi> hath been demonſtrated by many Pens; and that they are <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> is as evident: For accordin gto the <hi>Notion of Blaſphemy,</hi> even in the <hi>New Teſtament: He that aſſumes and appropriates to himſelf a property Divine, is a Blaſphemer, and in truth a ſetter up of more Gods than one;</hi> and of ſuch a Nature is their Doctrin of Infallibility. this is moſt Evident from <hi>Luke</hi> 5.20, 21. when the <hi>Jews</hi> Taxed Chriſt himſelf for ſpeaking Blaſphemy, who did not rayl, but only ſaid to the Paralitick Man, <hi>They ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Yet they (not acknowledging him to be God) did account it Blaſphemy in him to take upon him to forgive ſins, (which is a property meerly Divine) <hi>For who</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>can forgive ſins but God alone?</hi> ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, 9. <hi>I know the Blaſphemy of them that ſay they are Jews, and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> Much more he that ſays he is Infallible, (<hi>a property Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>)

Whereby it is apparent, that the Popes aſſuming to themſelves <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty Divine</hi> make themſelves guilty of Blaſphemy, and indeed of making more Gods than one, which is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Idolatry: To which if their <hi>Luciferian Dogma's</hi> be added, it will not mince the matter at all, <hi>viz.

            <p>Thus you ſee an Ambaſſade of Rebellion from the Popes Holineſs, by an old doting Proteſtant, a Fugitive and Conſpiriator unto ſome Noble Men, which were the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> Heads of the Rebellion that followed, the ſucceſs whereof he declares, <hi>viz.

This want of Information was ſoon after diligently and cunningly ſupplyed by ſending multitudes of the Seminaries and Jeſuits to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the people, as a Supplement to amend the former error.</p>
            <p>Though Dr. <hi>Sanders</hi> hath thus written, yet it may be ſaid by ſuch as favoured thoſe Two Noble Jeſuits <hi>Ro. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and <hi>Ed.

               <hi>Faculties granted to the Two Fathers</hi> Robert Parſons <hi>and</hi> Edmund Campion <hi>for</hi> England <hi>the</hi> 14. <hi>day of</hi> April 1580. <hi>by</hi> Gregory the XIII.</p>
            <p>Let it be asked or required of our moſt Holy Lord the Explication or meaning of the <hi>Bull</hi> declaratory, made by <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> againſt <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſuch as do adhere or obey her; which <hi>Bull</hi> the Catholicks deſire to be underſtood on this manner, that the ſame <hi>Bull</hi> ſhall always bind her and the Hereticks, but the Catholicks it ſhall by no means bind, as matters now ſtand or be; but hereafter when the publick Execution of that <hi>Bull</hi> may be had and made. Then in the Cloſe was added. The higheſt Pontiff or Biſhop granted the aforeſaid Graces or
<pb facs="tcp:179814:78"/>Faculties to Father <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> and <hi>Edmund Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> who are now to take their Journey into <hi>England</hi> 14. <hi>April</hi> 1580. being preſent the <hi>Father Oliverius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nark</hi> aſſiſtant.</p>
            <p>By this it is apparent, how all the Catholicks in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral did deſire to have the ſaid <hi>Bull</hi> (which is ſtill in force againſt all her Succeſſors, when ever it ſhall pleaſe his Holineſs ſo to declare it) to be underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt the Queen, but yet to be free themſelves; which is made more demonſtrable by the Confeſſion of <hi>Hart,</hi> one of their own Fellows, and Condemned, but not Executed with <hi>Campion,</hi> who <hi>ult. Decemb.</hi> 1580. Confeſſed, <hi>That the</hi> Bull <hi>of</hi> Pius Quintus, <hi>for ſo much as it is against the</hi> Queen, <hi>is holden amongst the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Catholicks for a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentence, and a ſufficient diſcharge of her Subjects fidelity, and ſo remaineth in force, but in ſome points touching the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it is altered by the preſent Pope.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Greg.</hi> XIII.</note> 
               <hi>For where in that</hi> Bull <hi>all her Subjects are commanded not to obey her; and ſhe being Excommunicate and Depoſed, all that do obey her are likewiſe Innodate and Accurſed, which point is perilous to the Catholicks; for if they obey her, they be in the Popes Curſe, and if they diſobey her they are in the Queens danger: Therefore the preſent Pope to relieve them hath altered that part of the</hi> Bull, <hi>and diſpenſed with them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and ſerve her without peril of Excomunication: which diſpenſation is to endure but till it pleaſe the Pope, otherwiſe to determine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the ſame reaſon that one Pope may receive and diſpenſe with a former Popes <hi>Bull,</hi> and ratifie one <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:179814:79"/>thereof, and make another void, and make what Interpretation thereof he pleaſeth <hi>pro re nata,</hi> to ſerve a turn: He may alſo by the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon declare the ſame <hi>Bull</hi> to be ſtill in force; and may at this very Nick of Time, and Juncture of Affairs diſpence with all our Catholicks by any ways or Arts to evade this laſt Act, and where are we then? and how the more ſecure?</p>
            <p>§ <hi>Edmund Campion,</hi> that Arch-Traytor, deeply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, and covertly as well as diligently preparing for the perpetrating of his Treaſons againſt Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> moſt cunningly before he came from <hi>Rome</hi> procured Tolleration for ſuch other prepared Rebels to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Covert under pretence of <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience</hi> to her Majeſty, the State ſtanding then as it did; but ſo ſoon as there ſhould be ſufficient force whereby the <hi>Bull</hi> of her Majeſties deprivation might be publickly Executed; they ſhould then joyn altogether with that force upon pain of Damnation, <hi>ex pede Herculem.</hi> By this you may gueſs, what kind of Obedience and Allegiance Papiſts ſwear to Proteſtant Princes, <hi>viz, temporary</hi> and <hi>permiſſive,</hi> i. e. during their will and pleaſures of their Lord God the Pope, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they ſhall be ſtrong enough to cut our Throats, whoſe Nails deſire to pare.</p>
            <p>§ It is likewiſe obſervable, that her Majeſties Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in their Examinations of Papiſts, ſuſpected Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (and thoſe only which were firſt known, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently probable by former Detections, Confeſſions,
<pb facs="tcp:179814:79"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) had a full purpoſe to follow the Example of the Queens moſt Gratious Diſpoſition, and never tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented any Innocent, or extorted Confeſſions at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon uncertainties; nor ever demanded any queſtion of their pretended or ſuppoſed Conſcience, as what they believed in any point of Faith or Doctrin, as of the Maſs, Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only with what perſons at home or abroad; and touching what Plots, Practiſes and Conferences they had dealt about attempts againſt her Majeſties perſon, or to alter the Laws of the Realm for matters of Religion; and how they were perſwaded themſelves, and did perſwade others touching the <hi>Popes Bull,</hi> and pretence of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to depoſe Kings, and namely for deprivation of her Majeſty, and to diſcharge Subjects from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance civily, without mentioning or meaning therein any right that the Queen, as in right of the Crown, had over perſons Eccleſiaſtical, being her Subjects.</p>
            <p>In all which Caſes <hi>Campion</hi> and the<note n="*" place="margin">Briant, Sherwin, Kirby, Cottam, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardſon, Fords, Short, Lewis, Filhee, Boſgrave, &amp; others.</note> reſt never anſwered plainly, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtically, deceitfully and traiterouſly <hi>reſtraining</hi> their confeſſion of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance only to the <hi>permiſſive tearm</hi> of the <hi>Popes Tolleration.</hi> As for Example, If they were asked, whether they did adknowledg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Queens Subjects, and would obey her, they would ſay, Yea, for ſo they have leave for a time to do; but being more narrowly interrogated, if they would ſo acknowledg and obey her any longer than the Pope would ſo permit them, or notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:179814:80"/>ſuch Commandement as the Pope would or might give to the contrary; then they either refuſed ſo to obey, or denyed to anſwer, or ſaid they would not anſwer to thoſe Queſtions without danger; which <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively</hi> was a plain Acknowledgment, that they would be no longer true Subjects, nor perſwade others to be ſo than the Pope gave them Licence ſo to be. And yet ſuch was their Impudence, that at their very Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they would <hi>(ad captandum populum)</hi> cry out that they were to dye, not for Treaſon, but for matter Faith and Conſcience in Doctrin, touching the Service of God without any attempt or purpoſe againſt her Majeſty, and that they were true Subjects, and did and would obey and ſerve her Majeſty; whereas in truth there was not the leaſt Syllable in their Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Faith or Doctrin; and conſequently not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be Arraigned, or be Executed for any ſuch thing: And to try whether ſuch their Hypocritical and Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Speeches and Anſwers did extend to a perpetuity of their obedience; or to ſo long time only as the Pope ſo permitted or no; they were immediately and publickly, even in the very place of their Arraignment, asked by her Majeſties Council, whether they would ſo obey, and be true Subjects, if the Pope commanded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; they plainly diſcovered themſelves in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; ſaying by the mouth of <hi>Campion,</hi> that this place (thereby meaning the Court of Her Majeſties Bench) hath no power to inquire or judg of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers Authority, and other Anſwer they would not make.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:179814:80"/>
            <p> For the better ſatisfaction of all people, and that they may the better and more plainly underſtand how, in what manner, and for what all the Papiſts dyed in <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> days; who moſt falſely have ſince been reported to have dyed for Religion, when in truth they dyed for Treaſon, and nothing elſe. Hereof take one Example and Inſtance for all, the Indictment and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of <hi>William Parry,</hi> that wicked, perfidious, faithleſs, ungrateful Traytor; ſworn Her Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1570. And as was his Indictment, ſo were all the other Indictments <hi>Mutatis Mutandis.</hi> Superlatively wicked in that he became twice recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to <hi>Rome,</hi> and in that he boaſted, That for 22 Years paſt he having been a Catholick, had never receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Communion; and yet before he travelled beyond the Sea at Three ſeveral times within thoſe 22 Years, he voluntarily take the Oath of Obedience to the Queen, made 1. of her Reign: Faithleſs and ungrateful in that after many obligations conferred on him by loan of ſeveral Sums of Money, and otherwiſe, by <hi>Hugh Hare</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> he contrived his death by breaking open his Chamber, aſſaulting and wounding, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for dead; for which being Convicted of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary, and Condemned to dye, the Queen moſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pardoned, for which he moſt gratefully requited her according to the old Proverb, <hi>Save a Thief from the Gallows, and he'l cut your Throat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was Indicted of Treaſon 22. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1584. by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> held at the <hi>Kings-Bench
<pb facs="tcp:179814:81"/>Weſtminſter</hi> before Sir <hi>Christopher Wray,</hi> Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of <hi>England</hi> and others, where <hi>Miles Sands</hi> Eſq; then Clerk of the Crown read the Indictment, <hi>viz.</hi> William Parry, <hi>thou art here Indicted by Oaths of Twelve good and lawful Men of the County of</hi> Middleſex, <hi>before</hi> Chriſtopher Wray, &amp; alias, <hi>for that thou as a Traytor againſt the moſt Noble and Chriſtian Princeſs Queen</hi> Eliz. <hi>the moſt Gralious Sovereign and Liege Lady; not having the fear of God before thine Eyes, nor regarding the due Allegiance, but being ſeduced by the Instigation of the Devil, and intending to withdraw and extinguiſh the hearty love and due obedience which true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects ſhould bear unto the ſame our Sovereign Lady, didst at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>in the County of</hi> Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex 1. Febr. <hi>in the</hi> 26. <hi>Year of Her Majeſties Reign, and at divers other times and places in the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty malitiouſly and traiterouſly conſpire and compaſs not only to deprive and depoſe the ſame our Sovereign Lady of Her Royal Eſtate, Title and Dignity, but alſo to bring her Highneſs to death and final deſtruction, and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Realm to make, and the Government thereof to ſubvert, and the ſincere Religion of God establiſhed in her Highneſs Dominions to alter and ſubvert. And that whereas thou</hi> William Parry <hi>by thy Letters ſent unto</hi> Gregory Biſhop <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>didſt ſignifie unto the ſame</hi> Biſhop <hi>the purpoſes and intentions aforeſaid, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by didſt pray and require the ſame</hi> Biſhop <hi>to give thee Abſolution, that thou afterwards, that is to ſay, the laſt of</hi> March 26. Year <hi>aforeſaid, didſt traiterouſly receive Letters from one called</hi> Cardinal de Como, <hi>directed unto thee</hi> William Parry, <hi>whereby the ſaid Cardinal did
<pb facs="tcp:179814:81"/>ſignifie unto thee, that the</hi> Biſhop <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>had peruſed the Letters, and allowed of thine intent, and that to that end he had abſolved thee of all thy ſins, and by the ſame Letter did animate and ſtir thee to proceed with thine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and that thereupon thou the last day of</hi> Auguſt <hi>in the ſaid</hi> 26. <hi>Year at St.</hi> Gyles <hi>in the Fields in the ſame County of</hi> Middleſex, <hi>didst traiterouſly confer with one</hi> Edmund Nevil <hi>Eſq; uttering unto him all the wicked and traiterous deviſes, and then and there didſt traiterouſly move him to aſſiſt thee therein, and to joyn with thee in thoſe wicked Treaſons aforeſaid againſt the peace of our ſaid Sovereign Lady the</hi> Queen <hi>her Crown and Dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which being Read, and <hi>William Parry</hi> being asked, whether guilty of theſe Treaſons, whereof thou ſtandeſt here Indicted, or not guilty? He confeſſed that he was guilty of all that is therein contained, both in matter and form as the ſame is ſet down, and all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof: Which being Recorded, and though confeſſed willingly by <hi>Parry,</hi> yet becauſe the Juſtice of the Realm had been of late very impudently ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That ſuch like Traytors were Executed for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and not for Treaſon, the Juſtice of that Court deemed it neceſſary to ſatisfie the World more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; that though his Confeſſion in Court ſerved ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to have proceeded thereupon to Judgment, yet <hi>Parry</hi>'s Confeſſion, (taken the 11, and 13. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1584. before the Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vice-Chamberlain,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi>) and <hi>Cardinal de Como</hi>'s letter, and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Letter to the <hi>Lord Treaſurer</hi> and <hi>Lord Steward</hi> ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:179814:82"/>be openly read; to which alſo <hi>Parry</hi> himſelf agreed ſo readily, that he offered to read them himſelf for the better ſatisfying of the people. All which Letters, and his own voluntary confeſſion written and ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own Hand he acknowledged to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed freely, without any conſtraint, and that it was all true, and more too. And that there is no Treaſon that hath been ſythence 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> any way touching Religion, (ſaving receipt of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and perſwading others wherein he hath not much dealt) but he had offended in it: And that he had demanded his opinion in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, who ought to be Succeſſor to the Crown, which he ſaid to be Treaſon alſo.</p>
            <p>All which Letters and Confeſſion being firſt ſhewed to him Leaf by Leaf, were openly and diſtinctly read by the Clark of the Crown.</p>
            <p>Which done, <hi>Parry</hi> having obtained favour of the Court to ſpeak in diſcharge (as he pretended) of his Conſcience, aſſuring them that he would not go about to excuſe himſelf, and that he intended to utter more; He ſaid my Cauſe is rare, ſingular and unnatural, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Venice,</hi> preſented in general Words to the Pope, undertaken at <hi>Paris,</hi> commended and allowed of by his Holineſs, and to have been Executed in <hi>England:</hi> I have committed many Treaſons; for I have committed Treaſon in being reconciled, and Treaſon in taking Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and yet <hi>never intended to kill Queen</hi> Eliz.</p>

            <p> Which ſaid, Mr. <hi>Vice-Chamberlain</hi> retorted upon him, in that he both in Court and elſe where under his Hand voluntarily confeſſed, <q>That he did miſlike Her Majeſty, for that ſhe had done nothing for thee; how by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Papiſts and Popiſh Books thou wert perſwaded, that it was lawful to kill Her Majeſty; how thou wert by reconciliation become one of that wicked ſort, that held Her Majeſty for neither lawful Queen nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? and that it was Meritorious to kill her? And didſt thou not ſignifie that thy purpoſe to the Pope by Letters, and receivedſt Letters from the Cardinal, how he allowed of thine intent, and Excited thee to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, and thereupon didſt receive Abſolution? And didſt thou not conceive it, promiſe it, vow it, ſwear it, and receive the Sacrament that thou wouldſt do it? And didſt not thou there upon affirm, that thy Vows were in Heaven, thy Letters and Promiſes on Earth to bind thee to do it? And that whatſoever Her Majeſty would have done for thee, could not have removed thee from the intention or purpoſe, unleſs ſhe would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from dealing as ſhe hath done with the Catholicks, as thou calledſt them. And didſt thou not confeſs, (beſides that which thou didſt ſet down under thine own Hand) that thou hadſt prepared Two <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Daggers fit for ſuch a purpoſe?</q> Notwithſtanding all theſe and more Demonſtrations of his Bloody Intentions againſt the <hi>Queen</hi> by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton,</hi> Lord <hi>Hunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and others of the Lords Commiſſioners; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in a furious manner cry'd, <hi>I never meant to kill Her, I will lay my Blood upon Her and you before God and the World,</hi> and ſo fell into a great rage and rayling. Which
<pb facs="tcp:179814:83"/>madneſs of his the Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> thus rebuked. <q>This is but thy Popiſh pride and oſtentation, which thou would have to be told to thy Fellows of thy Faction, to make them believe that thou dyedſt for Popery, when thou diedſt for moſt horrible and dangerous Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt Her Majeſty and the whole Countrey.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what little Faith is to be given to ſuch, who flatter with their Lips, and diſſemble with their dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hearts.</p>
            <p>Theſe things rightly conſidered, I do not doubt but that all good Subjects will clearly ſee; and all deluded and wavering perſons will perceive, how they have been ſeduced to wander out of the right way; and that all ſtrangers, eſpecially Chriſtian Princes having Sovereign Eſtates, being hereby acquainted with the true, juſt, and neceſſary Grounds and Reaſons of His Majeſties late <hi>Act of Parliament for preventing dangers which may happen from Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> made purely for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of His Majeſties Crown, Religion and People, and for prevention of Inteſtine Jars, that otherwiſe might be occaſioned through different Religions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions as diſcrepant as light and darkneſs; good and evil, which naturally occaſions diſputes, and ſometimes btows; that all the World perceiving upon how great Reaſons of State, and Grounds of Religion that Act was made, may be ſatisfied that no prudent State could do leſs; eſpecially the concern of Religion being a conſiderable Ingredient therein, which often ſets variance between neareſt Relations. And I cannot doubt but that this
<pb facs="tcp:179814:83"/>His Majeſties juſt Act will have the like happy entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſucceſs, as had King <hi>James</hi> (of ever bleſſed memory) his <hi>Monitory Preface</hi> unto his <hi>Apology;</hi> upon the coming forth of which Book there were no States that diſavowed the Doctrin of it in the point of the Kings power; the <hi>Venetians</hi> juſtified it both by Pen and Practiſe; the <hi>Sorbons</hi> maintained it; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> their Books to the contrary were burnt in <hi>France</hi> with ſcorn and diſdain.</p>
